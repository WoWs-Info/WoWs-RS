WoWs RS shows real-time player statistics of both teams (maximum 24 players in total) on your *phone* with [WoWs Info](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Re) and it works for all modes including rank. There are many similar and better tools, such as [wows stats](https://github.com/wows-stats/wows-stats), [wows stats plus](https://github.com/anmonite/wows-stats-plus), [Matchmaking Monitor](https://github.com/jammin411/MatchmakingMonitor), [WoWs Monitor](https://wows-monitor.com/) and [RAA](https://raa.sea-group.org/). This program is heavily inspired by `Matchmaking Monitor` and it is now one of the pro features of [WoWs Info](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Origin).

## Why use WoWs RS?
Is it better than other alternatives? Not really. WoWs RS is simply different and it aims to solve one major issue, dual monitor. It is not needed and you don't need to switch back to your desktop to check the stats and go back. It is on your phone and you can always see it. However, there are limitations. Your computer and your phone must be inside the same network (hotspot is fine). It doesn't work for certain networks (like uni wifi and more). 

Lastly, **do not judge others simply based on their stats.**

## Q & A
### It doesn't work for me
There are many reasons why it doesn't work. Therefore, you might need to do some testing by yourself, simply press the debug button in WoWs RS and WoWs Info app. 

If you cannot load the webpage on your computer, it mean that something is blocking the server. Please stop all vpn services in `task manager` (like nordvpn). 

If you can load the webpage on your computer but not on your phone, it means that you will need to use hotspot from your phone in order to use WoWs RS.

If you can load the webpage on both devices but it doesn't work in the app, please open an issue or send me an email. It means that there is something wrong with the app itself.
